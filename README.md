## Notes
- For the spotify API connection, the initial data pull and some of features are motivated by the work done in this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/part-iii-building-a-song-recommendation-system-with-spotify-cf76b52705e7
- the LLM from Mistral AI is used in two:
  1. to assign the raw artist music genres to a broad music category
  2. When recommender type == 'LLM', to output music recommendations based on user inputs
- Chat GPT was used to build out the HTML webpage

## Future Updates
- Increase size of music options table
- Add podcast recommendation functionality
